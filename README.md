# black sides browser extention#
[Before and after effect](./tree/master/docs/before.png)

It's meant to be used especially for one column websites, where there is too much white space on both sides of the window. I find it more comfortable when these areas are "switched off".

## What it does ##
This extension adds left and right borders of custom width on the current website by injecting div overlay. 

## How to use it ##
Open addon popup by clicking on its icon.  Click "+" or scroll up with mouse within popup area or:

hotkeys:
* F7: thinner borders
* F8: wider borders
* F9: on/off 

Settings for each website are saved in local storage.
